## Files Created/Modified

**Translation Files:**
- `src/messages/en.json` - Added 250+ English strings across 11 namespaces
- `src/messages/ar.json` - Added 250+ Arabic strings across 11 namespaces

**Voice Module Pages:**
- `src/app/[locale]/(main)/voice-agents/page.tsx` - Full translation support
- `src/app/[locale]/(main)/call-logs/page.tsx` - Full translation support
- `src/app/[locale]/(main)/phone-numbers/page.tsx` - Full translation support
- `src/app/[locale]/(main)/voice-settings/page.tsx` - Full translation support

**Documents Module Pages:**
- `src/app/[locale]/(main)/upload/page.tsx` - Full translation support
- `src/app/[locale]/(main)/templates/page.tsx` - Full translation support
- `src/app/[locale]/(main)/processing/page.tsx` - Full translation support
- `src/app/[locale]/(main)/data/page.tsx` - Full translation support

## Translation Statistics

- **Total strings added:** 250+
- **Namespaces:** 11 (VoiceAgents, CallLogs, PhoneNumbers, VoiceSettings, Upload, Templates, Processing, Data, Contacts, Settings, AgentEdit)
- **Languages:** English (EN), Arabic (AR)
- **Pages converted:** 11 secondary pages
- **Pattern used:** useTranslations('Namespace') + t('key') for all UI strings

## Decisions Made

1. **Client component translation pattern:** Used useTranslations hook consistently across all client components
2. **Namespace organization:** Organized translations by feature/module for better maintainability
3. **Translation key naming:** Used descriptive, consistent keys across all namespaces
4. **Mock data handling:** Kept mock data content in English (not translated), only translated UI labels and buttons

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. All Voice, Documents, Contacts, Settings, and Agent Edit pages successfully converted to use translations.

## Issues Encountered

None - all translations implemented smoothly, build succeeded without errors, user verification confirmed all pages display correctly in EN/AR.

## Phase 18.1 Complete

Full internationalization support now implemented across the entire application:
- **3 languages:** English (default), Arabic (with RTL support)
- **RTL layout:** Fully functional for Arabic with logical properties
- **LanguageSwitcher:** Working in header for language selection
- **All pages translated:** Core pages (18.1-03) + Secondary pages (18.1-04)
- **Build status:** ✓ Successful - 56 pages generated

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 18.1 complete! Application now fully supports EN/AR with RTL. Ready for Phase 19 (Performance & Polish) to optimize and finalize v4.0.

**Reference patterns:**
- TopBar component for page headers
- Card-based layouts with filtering (like Call Logs page)
- Two-panel layouts for detail views (like Call Logs)
- Orange service colors: #F59E0B → #EF4444
- Status indicators with color coding
- Table/grid views for data display
- Form inputs for editing extracted data

**Design specifications:**
- Service color: Orange gradient - apply to buttons, highlights, status indicators
- Processing Queue: Show active and completed processing jobs
- Extracted Data: Show extracted fields and values with edit capability
- Features: Real-time status updates, export options, search/filter
- Mock data: 5-10 processing jobs in various states

Purpose: Create a comprehensive overview that customers can see immediately upon login, showing ROI and status across all AI services.

Output: New unified dashboard component with 3 service health cards, unified metrics, and recent activity feed.

@.planning/STATE.md
@src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx

**Current state:**
- Dashboard exists with 4 KPI cards (Active Agents, Conversations, Resolution Rate, Response Time)
- Uses Recharts for visualization
- Shows 7-day trend chart with gradient
- Displays top channels distribution
- Uses mock data (hardcoded values)

**Architecture patterns:**
- Client component with React hooks for state
- Mock data pattern for demo purposes
- Card-based layout with hover effects
- Recharts for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS with gradient accents
- Animations on load (stagger effect)

**Design system available:**
- Colors: Accent gradient (blue/purple), new colors for Voice (teal) and Documents (orange)
- Spacing: 16px gap between cards
- Fonts: Bold headings with subtext for metric name
- Animations: Fade-in with stagger on load

**v1.0 dashboard components to leverage:**
- KPI card structure (shows metric + number + subtext)
- Chart visualization (Recharts)
- Layout patterns (grid, gaps, responsive)

**Constraints:**
- Keep existing trend chart (useful for all services)
- Add service-specific quick actions
- Use mock data initially (v2.1 will connect to real APIs)
- Maintain responsive design

  <name>Task 1: Replace current dashboard KPI cards with 3 service health cards</name>
  <files>src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Replace the current 4 KPI cards with 3 service health cards:

  Card 1: Conversational AI
  - Status: ✅ Active
  - Current: "847 conversations today"
  - Subtitle: "Multi-channel (WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook)"
  - Icon: Chat bubble (existing Inbox icon)
  - Color: Accent gradient (blue/purple)
  - Action button: "View Inbox"

  Card 2: Voice Agents
  - Status: ✅ Active
  - Current: "234 calls today"
  - Subtitle: "Phone answering & outbound"
  - Icon: Phone (new)
  - Color: Teal gradient (#10B981 → #06B6D4)
  - Action button: "Manage Voice"

  Card 3: Document Intelligence
  - Status: ✅ Active
  - Current: "89 documents processed today"
  - Subtitle: "Invoice, contract, and data extraction"
  - Icon: File (new)
  - Color: Orange gradient (#F59E0B → #EF4444)
  - Action button: "Process Documents"

  Card layout:
  - 3 columns on desktop, stack on mobile
  - Each card: status badge, large number, subtitle, icon, action button
  - Hover: subtle shadow increase, slight lift
  - Background: dark with gradient border (match v1.0 style)

  Use mock data for now (hard-code values). No API calls yet.
  </action>
  <verify>
  npm run dev && navigate to /dashboard
  - 3 service cards display in grid layout
  - Each card shows status, number, subtitle, icon, button
  - Cards use correct colors (blue, teal, orange)
  - No console errors
  </verify>
  <done>3 service health cards render with correct layout, colors, icons, and mock data</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add unified metrics and cross-service activity feed below service cards</name>
  <files>src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Add two sections below the service health cards:

  Section 1: Quick Stats (4 cards in row)
  - Total AI Interactions: 12,847
  - Active Services: 3 of 3
  - Cost Savings This Month: $23,400
  - Automation Rate: 87%

  Card styling: Simple, smaller than service cards. Show metric name and large value only.
  Mock data: Hard-code for now.

  Section 2: Recent Activity Feed
  - Show activity across all services
  - Format: [Icon] [Service] [Action] [Time]
  - Example items:
    - 🤖 Voice Agent handled call from +1-555-0123 (5m ago)
    - 💬 Chat conversation resolved with John Doe (12m ago)
    - 📄 Invoice processed: INV-2024-001 (23m ago)
    - 📞 Call transcription completed (1h ago)
  - Limit to 6 recent activities
  - Use scroll if needed

  Styling:
  - Feed items: subtle hover effect
  - Icons: service-specific (colored)
  - Time: light gray, right-aligned
  - Mock data: Hard-code 6 sample activities

  Layout:
  - Stats cards: 4 columns, 16px gap
  - Activity feed: full width below, 200px max-height, scroll if needed
  </action>
  <verify>
  npm run dev && navigate to /dashboard
  - 4 quick stat cards display below service cards
  - Activity feed shows 6 recent activities
  - Feed items have correct styling and icons
  - Scroll works if feed overflows
  - No console errors

  <done>Quick stats and activity feed render correctly with mock data, proper styling, and responsive layout</done>

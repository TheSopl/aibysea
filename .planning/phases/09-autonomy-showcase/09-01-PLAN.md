<objective>
Build a live Telegram conversation demo showing end-to-end autonomous AI handling with real-time decision transparency.

Purpose: Showcase to CEO that AI can handle entire conversations without human intervention. Show: AI detects problem, searches knowledge base, makes decision, responds, and completes resolution—all in real-time with visible confidence and reasoning.
Output: A curated Telegram conversation demonstrating autonomy with real metrics visible, decision trace showing AI's thinking, and clear success indicators.

**What "Autonomy Showcase" means:**
- Pre-recorded or live Telegram conversation
- Customer asks a question
- AI detects, reasons, searches KB, responds
- All visible in real-time with metrics/reasoning shown
- No human intervention required (AI handles completely)
- Shows confidence, latency, KB usage
- Ends with successful resolution

**Demo script example:**
Customer: "Do you have size L in blue?"
AI: [Searching inventory...] "Checking inventory... ✅ Yes! In stock, ships tomorrow."
Metrics visible: [🔍 Searched in 120ms] [✅ Decision: 92%] [📊 Action: Provide inventory + offer]

**Design considerations:**
- Conversation looks just like regular Telegram
- Metrics badges overlay on screen (not blocking message view)
- Color indicators: teal for AI confidence, amber for searching, green for success
- Smooth real-time message arrival
- Decision trace visible (expandable per message)

**Tech available:**
- All Phase 7-8 infrastructure
- Telegram integration from v1.0
- Design system with overlays, badges, animations

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Telegram demo conversation view with real-time message stream</name>
  <files>src/app/dashboard/demo/telegram-autonomy/page.tsx, src/components/demo/TelegramDemoView.tsx, src/components/demo/RealtimeDemoStream.tsx</files>
  <action>Build a dedicated demo page showing Telegram conversation. Messages arrive in real-time with animations (300ms fade-in + slide). Use Telegram-like styling: customer messages (light bubbles), AI messages (teal bubbles with Rashed avatar). Simulate a 2-3 minute conversation where AI autonomously handles inventory question, makes decision, and closes resolution. Implement smooth message arrival every 3-5 seconds (realistic chat pacing). Make messages clickable to expand reasoning/metrics.</action>
  <verify>npm run dev, visit /dashboard/demo/telegram-autonomy, see conversation streaming in real-time. Messages arrive with smooth animations. Telegram-like styling matches familiar chat interface. Conversation flows naturally.</verify>
  <done>Demo conversation page renders with real-time message stream, familiar Telegram styling, smooth animations, natural pacing</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add real-time metrics overlay and decision transparency badges</name>
  <files>src/components/demo/MetricsOverlay.tsx, src/components/demo/DecisionTrace.tsx</files>
  <action>Build metrics overlay that appears next to AI messages showing: [🔍 Searched inventory in 120ms], [✅ Decision: 92% confidence], [📊 Action: Provide inventory + offer], [🎯 Next: Wait for customer response]. Badges use teal for active, green for success, amber for processing. Decision trace (expandable): shows exact reasoning path (Detected intent → Search KB → Find match → Formulate response → Send with confidence). All uses design system colors and animations. Badges appear with slight delay (200ms) after message for emphasis.</action>
  <verify>npm run dev, watch conversation, metrics badges appear next to AI messages after slight delay. Expandable decision traces show reasoning. Colors match design system. Badges don't obstruct message readability.</verify>
  <done>Metrics overlay displays correctly, decision traces expandable, color-coded badges appear with good timing, professional appearance</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create conversation summary card and success indicators</name>
  <files>src/components/demo/DemoSummary.tsx</files>
  <action>After conversation completes, show summary card with: ✅ Conversation Resolved, Duration: 2m 15s, AI Decisions: 3, Success Rate: 100%, Total Confidence: 93% avg, KB Articles Used: 1 (Returns Policy), Customer Sentiment: Positive 🟢. Add "Play Again" button to restart demo. Use large green checkmarks, teal text for metrics, design system styling. Make eye-catching to emphasize successful autonomous handling.</action>
  <verify>After conversation ends, see summary card appear with smooth animation. All metrics display correctly. "Play Again" button functional. Summary card is visually distinct (green borders, teal text) to emphasize success.</verify>
  <done>Summary card displays successful resolution with all metrics, professional layout, "Play Again" button works, clear success messaging</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Add observer mode with live dashboard metrics synced to demo</name>
  <files>src/components/demo/ObserverDashboard.tsx</files>
  <action>Optional: Split screen showing conversation on left, mini-dashboard on right tracking: Real-time health score (94/100), conversation quality %, AI confidence trend, decision timeline. Dashboard updates as conversation progresses (confidence goes 85% → 88% → 92% as AI makes decisions). Shows what CEO sees in real dashboard while watching demo. Use design system: teal accents, glassmorphic cards, smooth animations. Make optional toggle on/off.</action>
  <verify>npm run dev, see split-screen option (conversation + live metrics). As conversation progresses, metrics update in sync. Health score, quality %, confidence trend update in real-time. Toggle works to hide metrics if preferred.</verify>
  <done>Observer dashboard optional but shows live metrics synced to demo, smooth updates, design system styled, toggle works</done>

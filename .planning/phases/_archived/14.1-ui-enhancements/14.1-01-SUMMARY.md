# Phase 14.1 Plan 01: UI Enhancements Summary

**Three UI enhancements: Manychat-style agent editor, optimized inbox animation, dashboard scrolling**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 18 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-21
- **Completed:** 2026-01-21
- **Tasks:** 6 implementation tasks + 1 verification checkpoint
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments

1. **AI Agent Editor** - Full-page Manychat-style editor with:
   - Collapsible sections: Instructions, Actions, Knowledge Sources, Model Settings
   - Action toggle cards for agent capabilities
   - Test Chat panel for previewing agent behavior
   - Support for both create (/agents/new/edit) and edit modes

2. **Inbox Animation Optimization** - Only animate last 6 messages when opening a conversation, preventing slow perceived load on long conversations

3. **Dashboard Scrolling** - Content scrolls within fixed background container

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1-4: Agent editor and list updates** - `8b5aa6c` (feat)
2. **Task 5: Inbox animation optimization** - `91295f7` (feat)
3. **Task 6: Dashboard scrolling** - `9dbab64` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/app/(main)/agents/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Full-page agent editor
- `src/app/(main)/agents/page.tsx` - Navigate to editor instead of modal
- `src/app/(main)/inbox/page.tsx` - Only animate last 6 messages
- `src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Scrollable content container

## Decisions Made

- **Full-page editor**: Rich configuration forms work better as full pages than modals
- **Animation threshold**: 6 messages is enough to feel smooth while preventing slowdown
- **Fixed background**: Background color on outer container, content scrolls independently

## Deviations from Plan

None - all features implemented as specified.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 14.1 (UI Enhancements) complete
- Ready for Phase 15: Dashboard Metrics

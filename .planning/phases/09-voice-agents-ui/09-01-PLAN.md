@src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx

**Reference pattern:**
- Conversational agents page shows 4 stats cards, agent list with selection, detail panel
- Uses mock data with agent status, metrics, and action buttons
- Styling: gradient backgrounds, hover effects, stagger animations
- Color scheme: primary/accent gradient for conversational service

**Voice Agents specifics:**
- Service color: Teal gradient (#10B981 → #06B6D4)
- Metrics: Active calls, total calls handled, average call duration, success rate
- Status: Active, Offline, On Break
- Icons: Phone for voice agents (Lucide Phone icon)
- Actions: Play/Pause, Edit, Delete, Transfer, Conference

**Design system available:**
- Teal service color defined in globals.css and Tailwind config (Phase 8-03)
- Service-specific shadows and gradients: 'shadow-service-voice-glow', 'from-teal-400 to-teal-600'
- Animation patterns: stagger effect on load (0.1s intervals), hover scale-up
- Typography: same font patterns as agents page (bold headings, light subtext)

**Constraints:**
- Create page structure matching agents page layout (list + detail panel)
- Use teal colors instead of accent gradient
- All mock data (real API in Phase 11)
- Maintain responsive design (3 column grid stats, stack on mobile)
- Include TopBar component with "Voice Agents" title

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create voice agents page structure with stats overview and agent list</name>
  <files>src/app/(main)/voice-agents/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Create new page at `src/app/(main)/voice-agents/page.tsx` with:

  1. TopBar component with title "Voice Agents"
  2. 4 stats cards in responsive grid (desktop 4 columns, mobile stack):
     - Active Voice Agents: count of agents with status='active'
     - Total Calls Handled: sum of totalCalls across all agents
     - Avg Call Duration: average duration in minutes
     - Call Success Rate: average successRate percentage

  3. Agent list section with:
     - Title "Your Voice Agents" with subtitle
     - "Create Voice Agent" button
     - Space for agent cards (Task 2)

  4. Create mock data:
     ```typescript
     const voiceAgents = [
       {
         id: 1,
         name: 'Sales Voice Agent',
         model: 'Voice.ai Pro',
         status: 'active',
         specialization: 'Sales & Qualification',
         totalCalls: 2847,
         avgDuration: 3.5,
         successRate: 92,
         activeCalls: 5,
         description: 'Handles outbound sales calls and lead qualification.'
       },
       // ... 2 more agents
     ]
     ```

  5. Stats cards styling:
     - Use teal colors: from-teal-400/10 to-teal-600/10, border-teal-400/20
     - Icon background: from-teal-400 to-teal-600
     - TrendingUp icon color: text-teal-500
     - Stagger animation: 0s, 0.1s, 0.2s, 0.3s delays

  6. Agent list card structure (placeholder - will be filled in Task 2):
     - Dark background with white text
     - Hover effects consistent with conversational agents
     - Click to select detail panel

  Do NOT implement the agent detail panel yet - save that for after Task 2.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add agent cards with status, metrics, and controls, plus detail panel</name>
  <files>src/app/(main)/voice-agents/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Complete the voice agents page by adding:

  1. Agent card rendering in the agent list:
     - Card layout matching conversational agents but tailored for voice
     - Show: agent icon (Phone), name, status dot (animated if active), model
     - Metrics grid (4 columns on desktop):
       - Calls Handled (totalCalls)
       - Avg Duration (avgDuration in minutes with "m" suffix)
       - Success Rate (successRate with % and progress bar)
       - Active Now (activeCalls)
     - Status badge: Green with pulse for "active", gray for "offline"
     - Action buttons:
       - Play/Pause toggle (amber pause icon if active, green play if offline)
       - Edit (primary color)
       - Delete (red)
       - Additional: Transfer (new for voice) and Conference (new for voice) - use subtle colors

  2. Styling for agent cards:
     - Selected state: Use teal colors (teal-400/10 and teal-400/30 border)
     - Icon background: Teal gradient (from-teal-400 to-teal-600)
     - Text colors: Match agents page (dark text for light bg, proper contrast)
     - Hover effects: scale-[1.02], shadow increase
     - Metrics text: Teal color for success rate (text-teal-500)

  3. Add useState hook:
     - selectedAgent state to track which agent is selected
     - Default to voiceAgents[0]

  4. Agent detail panel (right side, w-96, sticky top-8):
     - Header: Agent icon, name, model
     - Status section: Show status badge with dot
     - Specialization field
     - Description field
     - Performance section with:

     - Buttons at bottom:
       - "Configure Agent" (gradient button)
       - "View Call Logs" (light background, will link to /call-logs)

  5. Flex layout:
     - Agent list: flex-1
     - Detail panel: w-96
     - Gap between: gap-6

  6. Animations:
     - Card fade-in with stagger (0.6s delay + index * 0.1s)
     - Agent icons: scale-110 on hover/active (same as agents page)
  </action>
  <verify>
  npm run dev && navigate to /voice-agents
  - Agent cards render with all fields visible
  - Cards use teal colors consistently
  - Status dots animate (pulse when active)
  - Action buttons present and interactive (click handling not required yet)
  - Detail panel shows on the right (w-96, sticky)
  - Clicking agent card updates detail panel
  - Hover effects work: card scales, buttons respond
  - Success rate progress bar fills to correct percentage
  - Responsive layout works (detail panel should collapse on mobile)
  - No console errors or TypeScript errors

- Integrated mock data with 3 sample voice agents
- Implemented animations and responsive layout

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/app/(main)/voice-agents/page.tsx` - Complete Voice Agents management page with stats, list, and detail panel

## Implementation Details

### Stats Cards
- **Active Voice Agents**: Shows count of agents with active status
- **Total Calls Handled**: Aggregates totalCalls from all agents
- **Avg Call Duration**: Calculates average duration across agents
- **Call Success Rate**: Shows average success rate percentage
- Color: Teal gradient backgrounds with teal-500 accent icons
- Animation: Stagger effect on load (0.1s intervals)

### Agent Cards
- Display agent name, status indicator, specialization
- Metrics grid: Calls Handled, Avg Duration, Success Rate, Active Now
- Action buttons: Play/Pause, Edit, Delete, Transfer (new), Conference (new)
- Status indicators: Green pulse for active, gray for offline
- Teal colors for success rate and gradient icons

### Detail Panel
- Shows full agent information: name, model, status
- Specialization and description display
- Performance metrics with teal progress bar for success rate
- Action buttons for agent configuration and call logs access
- Sticky positioning for easy access while scrolling agent list

## Design Decisions

- Used teal color scheme to differentiate Voice service from Conversational (accent) and Documents (orange)
- Matched UI patterns from conversational agents page for consistency
- Mock data includes phone-specific metrics (call duration, call count, success rate)
- Detail panel follows same pattern as conversational agents for familiar UX
- Status indicators use animated pulse for active agents to show live state

## Next Steps

Ready for 09-02-PLAN.md (Call Logs page)
